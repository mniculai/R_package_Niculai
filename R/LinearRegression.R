# This file would contain the linear model for linear regression looking at the relationship between two variables 
# the inputs would be the linear regression between carapace_length and body depth to plot the visual model and obtain data on relationship. 
#output would be a visual plot of the relationship as well as a summary table of the data to determine relationship with residuals & coefficients.
