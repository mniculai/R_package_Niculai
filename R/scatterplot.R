#For the input i would expect to put the column data x axis to be carapace length with y axis being carapace width. 
#I would expect the output to be various dots scattered distributing the varied length x width patterns of the crab data.
#I would set this plot up to see the overall snapshot picture of overall size of these crabs in relation to length and width dimensions.
