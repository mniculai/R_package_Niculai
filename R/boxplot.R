#For this box plot i would expect to have the input to be carapace length for x axis and color differentiation for y axis. 
#The expected outcome would be a box plot of two box and whisker plots with blue and orange colors being in the data set.
#These variables where chosen because i wanted to visualize the total size in length between groups based on color to see 
#which color had larger lenth sizes and the variance in length.
