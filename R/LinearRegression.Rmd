# This file would contain the linear model for linear regression looking at the relationship between two variables 
# the inputs would be the linear regression between carapace_length and body depth to plot the visual model and obtain data on relationship. 
#output would be a visual plot of the relationship as well as a summary table of the data to determine relationship with residuals & coefficients.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# predictor goes on X, response goes on Y
ggplot(crabs_data, aes(x = carapace_length, y = body_depth)) + 
  geom_point()

```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model_fit <- lm(body_depth ~ carapace_length, data = crabs_data)
summary(model_fit)
```
