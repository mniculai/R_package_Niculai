#For this box plot i would expect to have the input to be carapace length for x axis and color differentiation for y axis. 
#The expected outcome would be a box plot of two box and whisker plots with blue and orange colors being in the data set.
#These variables where chosen because i wanted to visualize the total size in length between groups based on color to see 
#which color had larger lenth sizes and the variance in length.

ggplot(data = crabs_data, mapping = aes(x = color, y = carapace_length)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")
